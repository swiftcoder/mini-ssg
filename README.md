tiny static site generator in rust (mostly for my own use)

I've been using [Zola](https://getzola.org) for a while now, but I'm frustrated by some of the limitations I'm running into when trying to build complicated feeds. This static site generator is intended to be a lightweight alternative that only supports a subset of Zola's functionality, but uses some simpler abstractions that allow a little more flexibilty to the user.
